#  The Agentic Architect: Self-Healing Lakehouses
This repository contains a reference implementation for an autonomous data operations agent. It is designed to shift data teams from reactive "firefighting" to high-level system governance.

###  Core Stack (DAIS 2026 Ready)
- **Agent Framework:** Databricks Mosaic AI
- **Storage Isolation:** Lakebase Zero-Copy Branching
- **Metadata Nervous System:** Unity Catalog System Tables

###  The Vision
In a lakehouse with thousands of tables, manual repair doesn't scale. This project demonstrates how an AI Agent can detect a failure, create a safe sandbox in **Lakebase**, and propose a verified fix—all before an engineer has to open a ticket.
